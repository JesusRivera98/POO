## General info

In this course we learned about Object Oriented Programming using PHP, Java, Python and JavaScript, in this process we use many different concepts

|Concept | Meaning|
|-|-|
| Inheritance | Classes use the values and functions of superclasses |
| Abstraction | Classes that share characteristics generalize and create a superclass |
| Class | They are the models on which we will build objects |
| Object | The instance of a class |
| Encapsulation | Limit the scope of a variable or function |
| Polymorphism | Modify the behavior depending on the context |

We make a class model based on the operation of Uber creating classes with inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation in PHP, Java, Python and JavaScript

As a result of this project we obtained a [web page](https://jesusrivera98.github.io/hyperblog/blogspot.html) based on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
